- ✅ Check if you have the right tools installed
- ✅ Help install anything you're missing
- ✅ Start the website at http://localhost:8080
- ✅ Open your browser automatically

## 📋 Prerequisites for Contributors

Before you start contributing, make sure you have:

1. **🤖 An AI Coding Assistant** — Like [Antigravity](https://console.cloud.google.com/), Cursor, GitHub Copilot, or similar "vibe coding" tools
2. **🐙 A GitHub Account** — Free at [github.com/signup](https://github.com/signup)
3. **📚 Basic Git Knowledge** — Learn the basics at [Git Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/git/)
4. **🌐 Some HTML/CSS/JS** — Learn at [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)

> 💡 **Tip:** You can ask your AI coding agent to explain any code you don't understand — it's a great way to learn!

## 🎨 How to Contribute (Vibe Coding Style!)

Contributing is easy with AI assistance:

1. **Find an issue** — Something looks broken or could be better?
2. **Take a screenshot** — Show your AI what's wrong
3. **Ask your AI agent** — "Can you help me fix this?"
4. **Test it** — Run `./startup.sh` and check your changes
5. **Submit a Pull Request** — Share your fix with everyone!

See our [Vibe Coding Guide](docs/vibe-coding-guide.md) for detailed tips!
