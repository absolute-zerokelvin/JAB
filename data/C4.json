Jainism places great importance on our mental state, as our thoughts and intentions determine the type of karma we accumulate, often more so than the actions themselves. The famous story of six friends finding a fruit tree illustrates the six types of Leshyä. Their thoughts ranged from cutting down the whole tree (worst Leshyä) to just picking up the fruit that had already fallen (best Leshyä)."
