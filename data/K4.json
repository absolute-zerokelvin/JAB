It is a measure on a spiritual yardstick, determined by the state of the soul's beliefs, conduct, and the influence of karmic matter. The journey progresses from a state of complete wrong belief (Mithyātva) to the state of a liberated soul (Paramātmā). This progression is influenced by the fruition (<i>Uday</i>), suppression (<i>Upasham</i>), and perishing (<i>Kshayopasham</i>) of karmas."
