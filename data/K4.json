"header":"What is a Gunasthän?",
"content":"A <b>Gunasthän</b> (literally'stage of virtue') represents a specific psychical condition or spiritual stage of a soul in its journey towards liberation (Moksha). It is a measure on a spiritual yardstick, determined by the state of the soul's beliefs, conduct, and the influence of karmic matter. The journey progresses from a state of complete wrong belief (Mithyātva) to the state of a liberated soul (Paramātmā). This progression is influenced by the fruition (<i>Uday</i>), suppression (<i>Upasham</i>), and perishing (<i>Kshayopasham</i>) of karmas."
 },
 {
"header":"The Soul's Journey & States",
"content":"The soul's journey through the Gunasthans is not a simple, linear ascent. A soul can move up and down the stages based on its internal state and karmic load. There are three primary states of the soul corresponding to these stages:<br><ul><li><span style='color:#C0392B;'><b>Bahirātmā (Extrovert Soul):</b></span> Stages 1-3. The soul is engrossed in external objects and activities, identifying itself with the body and worldly possessions.</li><li><span style='color:#2980B9;'><b>Antarātmā (Introvert Soul):</b></span> Stages 4-12. The soul turns inward, concerned with its own spiritual welfare and purification. It differentiates itself from the body and karma.</li><li><span style='color:#F1C40F;'><b>Paramātmā (Perfect Soul):</b></span> Stages 13-14. The soul attains Godhood, becoming an omniscient, perfect being, free from all defiling karmas.</li></ul>"
 },
 {
"header":"The Role of Karma",
"content":"Gunasthans are directly tied to karma bondage. The primary karma influencing these stages is <span style='color:#8E44AD;'><b>Mohaniya (Deluding) Karma</b></span>, which has two main sub-types:<br>1. <b>Darshan Mohaniya:</b> Faith-deluding karma, which causes wrong belief (Mithyātva).<br>2. <b>Chāritra Mohaniya:</b> Conduct-deluding karma, which obstructs right conduct and gives rise to passions (Kashāy).<br>Progress through the Gunasthans involves systematically suppressing or eradicating these karmas."
 },
 {
"header":"The Five Causes of Āsrav",
"content":"The spiritual state is also defined by the presence or absence of the five causes of karmic influx (Āsrav). Progressing to higher Gunasthans requires eliminating these causes one by one:<br>1. <b>Mithyātva</b> (Wrong Faith)<br>2. <b>Avirati</b> (Vowlessness / Indiscipline)<br>3. <b>Pramād</b> (Negligence / Laziness)<br>4. <b>Kashāy</b> (Passions: Anger, Pride, Deceit, Greed)<br>5. <b>Yoga</b> (Activities of mind, body, and speech)"
