            "content": "Anekāntavād, literally meaning 'the multiplicity and relativity of viewpoints,' is a central tenet of Jain philosophy. It posits that reality is complex and multifaceted, and truth can be viewed from various perspectives. From the Jain standpoint, it is possible to overcome the apparent inconsistencies between different views to grasp the underlying truth. It argues that any single viewpoint represents only a partial truth and that absolute truth is the sum of all these partial, relative viewpoints. This principle fosters tolerance and a comprehensive understanding of reality."

            "content": "This classic story elegantly demonstrates Anekāntavād. Six blind men each touch a different part of an elephant—the leg, tail, trunk, ear, belly, and tusk—and each concludes the elephant is like a pillar, a rope, a python, a fan, a drum, and a pipe, respectively. They argue, each certain of their own conclusion. A wise person explains they are all partially correct, as they only perceived a fraction of the whole reality. This teaches us that non-omniscient beings have limited knowledge. Only an <span style='color:#00796b;'>omniscient being (Kevali)</span> can perceive the whole truth. Thus, we should express our views with humility, acknowledging they are true only from our limited perspective."
