It is the means of knowing an object as it is, in its entirety, encompassing all its aspects. Jain philosophy divides Pramāṇa into two primary modes: <b>Pratyaksha</b> (direct knowledge) and <b>Paroksha</b> (indirect knowledge).

While Pramāṇa provides a complete picture, a Naya illuminates a single facet of reality. According to Siddhasen Diwākar, a thing conceived from one particular point of view is the object of Naya. It is essential for understanding complex realities without making absolute claims."

It posits that ultimate reality is complex and possesses infinite characteristics. Therefore, truth and reality are perceived differently from different points of view, and no single point of view can be the complete truth. It is the foundation for Naya and Syādvāda."

It recommends that the prefix 'Syāt' (meaning 'in some respect' or 'perhaps') be attached to every expression. This prevents absolutism in speech and judgment. It is systematically presented through the Sapta-Bhanga, or the seven-fold predications."

By acknowledging the validity of other viewpoints, it fosters tolerance and understanding, thus promoting non-violence in the realm of thought and speech. It aims to stop the 'war of beliefs' which often leads to conflict."

Example: Referring to all beings in a hall as 'people', ignoring age or gender.<br><br><b>3.

Example: A king is only a king at the present moment of his reign, not before or after.<br><br><b>5. Shabda Naya (Literal View):</b> Insists that synonymous words are only interchangeable if they match in tense, gender, case, etc. It treats each word with its precise grammatical value. Example: 'Pot' and 'pitcher' might mean the same, but this naya differentiates them.<br><br><b>6. Samabhirudha Naya (Etymological View):</b> Distinguishes between synonyms based on their root meanings (etymology). Example: A 'palace' and a 'hut' are both places to live, but their root meanings imply different qualities and inhabitants.<br><br><b>7. Evambhuta Naya (Determinant View):</b> The most specific naya, asserting that a word should only be used for an object when it is actively performing the function denoted by the word. Example: A person is only a 'thief' at the exact moment of stealing."
