Though engaged to eight women from respected families, Jambu's life took a different course after hearing a sermon by Ganadhar <span class=\"highlight\">Sudharmä-swämi</span>. The sermon inspired in him a profound sense of detachment, and he declared his intention to become a monk."

As a last resort, they begged him to at least go through with the wedding, hoping married life would change his mind. Jambu agreed, but on one condition: he would renounce the world the very next day."
