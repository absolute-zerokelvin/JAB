            "content": "Panchächär, meaning 'five conducts', represents the practical observance of Jainism. It is a comprehensive framework guiding a soul towards liberation. As stated by Ächārya Umāsvāti in the Tattvārtha-sutra: '<i>Samyag Darshan, Samyag Jnän and Samyak Chäritra constitute the path of liberation.</i>' While these are the three core jewels, Jainism expands this into a fivefold code by including two significant aspects of conduct: Austerities (Tap) and Vigor (Virya). These five codes are Jnänächär, Darshanächär, Chäriträchär, Tapächär, and Viryächär."

            "header": "1. Jnänächär - Code of Acquiring Right Knowledge",
            "content": "This code lays down the norms for acquiring right knowledge (Samyag Jnän). It involves understanding the five types of knowledge, from sensory perception to ultimate omniscience, and practicing the eightfold disciplines like studying at the proper time, showing reverence to teachers, and understanding the true meaning of scriptures. The goal is to overcome the knowledge-obscuring (Jnänävaraniya) karma."

It involves cultivating an unwavering belief in the principles of Jainism, free from doubt, expectation, or influence from other doctrines. The eight aspects of Darshanächär guide a person from initial belief to profound self-realization."

            "content": "This is the code of right conduct (Samyak Chäritra), where knowledge and faith are put into practice. It involves living life in accordance with Jain principles. For monastics, this includes observing the five Samitis (carefulness) and three Guptis (restraints), collectively known as Ashta Pravachan Mätä. For laypeople, it involves observing the twelve vows (Vrat)."

            "content": "This code pertains to the practice of austerities (Tap). Austerities are physical and mental exercises designed to purify the soul and shed accumulated karmas (Nirjarä). Jainism outlines twelve types of austerities, divided into six external (Bähya) and six internal (Abhyantar), to aid in spiritual development."

It emphasizes avoiding laziness and negligence, and channeling all energy into observing the other four codes of conduct. It is the practice of conscious endeavor (Purushärth) to overcome karmic bondage."
