 {
"header":"What is Panchächär?",
"content":"Panchächär, meaning'five conducts', represents the practical observance of Jainism. It is a comprehensive framework guiding a soul towards liberation. As stated by Ächārya Umāsvāti in the Tattvārtha-sutra:'<i>Samyag Darshan, Samyag Jnän and Samyak Chäritra constitute the path of liberation.</i>' While these are the three core jewels, Jainism expands this into a fivefold code by including two significant aspects of conduct: Austerities (Tap) and Vigor (Virya). These five codes are Jnänächär, Darshanächär, Chäriträchär, Tapächär, and Viryächär."
 },
 {
"header":"1. Jnänächär - Code of Acquiring Right Knowledge",
"content":"This code lays down the norms for acquiring right knowledge (Samyag Jnän). It involves understanding the five types of knowledge, from sensory perception to ultimate omniscience, and practicing the eightfold disciplines like studying at the proper time, showing reverence to teachers, and understanding the true meaning of scriptures. The goal is to overcome the knowledge-obscuring (Jnänävaraniya) karma."
 },
 {
"header":"2. Darshanächär - Code of Gaining Right Faith",
"content":"This code focuses on developing right faith or conviction (Samyag Darshan). It involves cultivating an unwavering belief in the principles of Jainism, free from doubt, expectation, or influence from other doctrines. The eight aspects of Darshanächär guide a person from initial belief to profound self-realization."
 },
 {
"header":"3. Chäriträchär - Code of Acquiring Right Conduct",
"content":"This is the code of right conduct (Samyak Chäritra), where knowledge and faith are put into practice. It involves living life in accordance with Jain principles. For monastics, this includes observing the five Samitis (carefulness) and three Guptis (restraints), collectively known as Ashta Pravachan Mätä. For laypeople, it involves observing the twelve vows (Vrat)."
 },
 {
"header":"4. Tapächär - Code of Acquiring Right Austerities",
"content":"This code pertains to the practice of austerities (Tap). Austerities are physical and mental exercises designed to purify the soul and shed accumulated karmas (Nirjarä). Jainism outlines twelve types of austerities, divided into six external (Bähya) and six internal (Abhyantar), to aid in spiritual development."
 },
 {
"header":"5. Viryächär - Code of Exercising Right Vigor",
"content":"This code is about exercising one's physical, mental, and spiritual energy (Virya) appropriately and to its fullest potential towards the goal of liberation. It emphasizes avoiding laziness and negligence, and channeling all energy into observing the other four codes of conduct. It is the practice of conscious endeavor (Purushärth) to overcome karmic bondage."

"content":"Viryächär is the code of exercising one's energy (Virya) in the right manner for spiritual upliftment. It requires using one's mental, verbal, and physical capabilities to their fullest potential in observing the other codes of conduct (knowledge, faith, conduct, austerities). It is the antidote to laziness, negligence, and lethargy. As Bhagawän Mahävir stated, one should not be lazy for even a single moment on the journey towards liberation."

"content":"While Jainism believes in karma, it does not support passivity. Prärabdha (destiny) is the result of past karmas, but Purushärth (endeavor) is the conscious effort one makes in the present to overcome the effects of that karma. Viryächär is the essence of Purushärth, emphasizing that one should observe all spiritual codes with utmost vigor and determination, rather than being a helpless victim of past actions."
 },
 {
"header":"Five Vices (Pramäd) that Hinder Spiritual Growth",
"content":"Pramäd means negligence or spiritual laziness. To practice Viryächär, one must avoid these five major types of vices:<br><br><b>1. Vishay:</b> Indulgence in the five sensuous pleasures (sound, sight, smell, taste, touch).<br><b>2. Kashäy:</b> The four inner passions of Anger (Krodh), Ego (Män), Deceit (Mäyä), and Greed (Lobh).<br><b>3. Vikathä:</b> Indulging in unnecessary or sinful talk, such as gossip about politics, food, or nation.<br><b>4. Nidrä:</b> Excessive sleep or a state of non-alertness and lethargy.<br><b>5. Vyasan:</b> Addiction to material objects or harmful habits like gambling and smoking."
