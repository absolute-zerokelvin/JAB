"tagHTML":"<span class=\"highlight\">Vimalshä</span> was a capable and outstanding commander during the Solanki dynasty's golden period in Gujarat. As a young man, he was known for his skill in horseback riding and archery. He and his intelligent brother <span class=\"highlight\">Nedh</span> joined the service of <span class=\"highlight\">King Bhimdev</span> in the capital city of Pätan. Nedh became a chancellor, and Vimal became a commander, marrying a beautiful woman named <span class=\"highlight\">Shridevi</span>."

"tagType":"p",
"tagHTML":"Some courtiers grew jealous of Vimalshä's success. They noticed he would only bow to the Tirthankars before anyone else, even the king. They poisoned the king's mind, telling him Vimalshä was arrogant and might even try to take the throne. Growing suspicious, King Bhimdev turned against Vimalshä."
 },
 {
"tagType":"p",
"tagHTML":"Feeling the king's distrust, Vimalshä left Pätan and went to Mount Äbu (then called Chandraväti). There, he defeated the local chief, <span class=\"highlight\">Dhandhuk</span>, who was trying to rebel against King Bhimdev. Vimalshä took control of the region in the king's name, acting as its governor."

He met a Jain Ächärya, <span class=\"highlight\">Dharmaghosh-suri</span>, and felt deep remorse for the violence in his past wars. The Ächärya advised him to build a temple to atone for his sins. Vimalshä also prayed to the goddess <span class=\"highlight\">Ambikä Devi</span>, who offered him a choice: a son, or the ability to build a great temple. <span class=\"highlight\">Vimalshä chose the temple.</span>"

"tagHTML":"The project was immense. It took <span class=\"highlight\">14 years</span> and cost a fortune. Artisans were brought from far away, and there wasn't even a road up the mountain. Vimalshä famously paid the sculptors in gold equal to the weight of the marble dust they carved each day. The result was a temple of such exquisite beauty that it is considered a world wonder."

Taking her advice, the brothers decided to use the treasure to build the second great temple on Mount Äbu, the <span class=\"highlight\">Lunaga Vasahi Temple</span>. In this temple, Tejpäl dedicated two special niches, known as <span class=\"highlight\">\"Deräni-Jethäni nä Gokhla,\"</span> to commemorate his wife and his sister-in-law."
