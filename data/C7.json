Forgiveness is not something we do for others; it's a gift to ourselves, freeing us from the weight of resentment and pain. By forgiving, we advance on the path to liberation."

Humility is recognizing our own insignificance in the vast universe and showing respect for all. To be humble, one must abandon the eight types of pride, such as pride of knowledge, appearance, or family status."

It doesn't mean not earning a living, but being satisfied with what one has and limiting possessions to what is necessary. True happiness comes from within, not from material acquisitions."
