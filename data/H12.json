      "tagHTML": "Once, the king had gone hunting. He spotted a fleeing deer. The king spurred his horse and pursued it. Ultimately, he located it taking rest under a tree. He wielded his arrow with all his might. The arrow pierced the body of the deer, thereby killing the deer, as well as the unborn child in its body. The arrow emerged out of the animal and then pierced a tree trunk and came out its other side, too. Instead of regretting this violence, the king felt proud and elated at his abilities. His arrogance around this violent deed led to him acquiring the karma of leading an infernal life."

Bhagawän Mahävir pointed out that his karma was indelible and bound to become operative. Such intense Karma cannot be erased without bearing the fruits. The law of karma is supreme, and no one has authority over its operation."

The king approached the man, but Puniä explained that merits and demerits are non-transferable. The king was disappointed.</li><li>The king had a servant named <span class=\"highlight\">Kapila</span> who never gave alms. Bhagawän Mahävir suggested the king make her give alms. The king tied a scoop to her hand, but as she gave alms, she murmured that the king’s scoop was giving the alms, not her, thus failing the task.</li><li>The king had a butcher named <span class=\"highlight\">Kälsaurik</span>. Bhagawän Mahävir suggested the king make the butcher not slaughter for one day. The king had Kälsaurik put in a dry well, but the butcher, so conditioned to kill, made animals from wet clay and pretended to kill them. This plan also failed.</li><li>Bhagawän Mahävir then asked the king to observe the restraint of one <span class=\"highlight\">Navakärashi</span> (not eating or drinking until 48 minutes after sunrise). The next morning, the king went to his garden, saw ripe berries, and by merely thinking of eating them, broke the restraint.</li>"
