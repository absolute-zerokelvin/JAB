A layperson, known as a <b>Shrävak</b> (male) or <b>Shrävikä</b> (female), follows rules of conduct that are less rigid than those for ascetics but are designed to lead toward the same ultimate goal of liberation. These rules are outlined in the twelve vows of a householder."

They include limited non-violence (avoiding intentional harm), limited truthfulness (avoiding malicious lies), limited non-stealing (not taking what isn't given), limited celibacy (chastity within marriage), and limited non-possessiveness (setting a limit on wealth and possessions)."

"content":"These vows support and strengthen the Anuvrats. They include <b>Dig Parimän Vrat</b> (limiting one's worldly activities to a specific geographical area), <b>Bhoga-Upbhoga Parimän Vrat</b> (limiting the use of consumable and non-consumable items), and <b>Anartha-danda Viraman Vrat</b> (avoiding purposeless sins like carelessness or manufacturing weapons)."

"content":"These vows provide training for a more spiritual life. They include <b>Sämäyik Vrat</b> (meditating in equanimity for at least 48 minutes), <b>Desävakäsik Vrat</b> (imposing stricter, temporary limits on activity), <b>Paushadh Vrat</b> (living the life of a monk for a limited period), and <b>Atithi Samvibhäg Vrat</b> (giving charity, especially to monks and the needy)."

 {
"tagType":"p",
"tagHTML":"<b>Sanlekhanä</b> is a highly advanced spiritual practice for a householder or ascetic who has followed the vows diligently. It is a well-ordered, voluntary death undertaken in a state of complete awareness and meditation, usually when old age or incurable disease prevents further spiritual progress and makes one a burden on society. It is performed under the supervision of a guru and involves a gradual withdrawal from food and water."
 },
 {
"tagType":"p",
"tagHTML":"This practice is fundamentally different from suicide. Suicide is the result of passion, anger, or depression, while Sanlekhanä is the ultimate act of dispassion, involving a calm renunciation of the body without fear or sorrow."
