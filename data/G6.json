He mastered the scriptures and understood the nature of karma, allowing him to maintain a high level of equanimity. He rigorously followed the entire monastic code of conduct with one exception: he could not overcome his hunger and was unable to fast."

While his fellow monks undertook long fasts, Kurgadu would praise their efforts and serve them devoutly, all the while regretting his own inability, which he attributed to his past karma."
