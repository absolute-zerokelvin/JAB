More than 2,500 years ago, Bhagaw채n Mah채vir proclaimed a profound truth: every form of life wants to live and fears death, just as we do. This understanding is the root of non-violence. The philosophy of Ahims채 is not merely refraining from physical violence, but a deep reverence for all life that must be incorporated into our thoughts, words, and actions."

A vegetarian or vegan lifestyle becomes the natural outcome of this inner understanding. The more developed a being's senses are, the more pain it can feel, which is why violence against animals with five senses is a greater sin than violence against one-sensed plants."

The modern dairy industry is inherently linked to the meat industry. Female cows that stop producing sufficient milk are sent to be slaughtered, and male calves are often raised for veal. This cruelty is why many Jains advocate for a vegan diet."

Egg-laying hens are confined to small, crowded 'battery cages' where they cannot stretch their wings, leading to frustration and injury. To prevent fighting, their beaks are painfully cut off. After a year, when their egg production wanes, they are sent to slaughterhouses. Furthermore, male chicks, being of no economic value to the egg industry, are typically killed the day they hatch."
