One was the famous Swämi Vivekänanda, representing Hinduism. The other was <span class=\"highlight\">Shri Virchand Räghavji Gandhi</span>, a 29-year-old scholar representing Jainism. His eloquence and deep knowledge were so impressive that an American newspaper wrote, “Of all the Eastern scholars, it was this youth whose lectures on Jain faith and conduct were listened to with great interest and attention.”"
