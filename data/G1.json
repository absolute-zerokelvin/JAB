      "tagHTML": "Before his renunciation of worldly life, Bhagawän Rishabhadev, or Ädinäth, was known as King Rishabh and had two wives, Sumangalä and Sunandä. With Sumangalä, he had 99 sons, of whom Bharat was the eldest, and one daughter named Brähmi. With the second wife, Sunandä, he had one son named Bähubali and a daughter named Sundari. All of them were given proper training in different arts and crafts. Bharat became a great warrior and a politician. Bähubali was tall, well built, and strong, and hence was given his name. In Sanskrit, “bähu” means arm and “bali” means mighty. Brähmi attained a very high level of literary proficiency. She developed the first known script, known as the Brähmi script. Sundari was very proficient in mathematics. After Bhagawän Rishabhadev attained omniscience, both daughters also renounced their worldly lives and became his disciples."

      "tagHTML": "As a king, Rishabhadev had the responsibility of a large kingdom. At the time of his renunciation, he handed over the city of Vinitä, also known as Ayodhyä, to Bharat, and the city of Taxashilä (Potanpur according to Digambar scriptures) to Bähubali. He gave different parts of his vast kingdom to his remaining 98 sons. Bharat quickly established control over Vinita. He was an ambitious ruler and intended to become emperor of the entire nation. For this purpose, he organized a strong army and started developing different types of fighting equipment. He also possessed a miraculous wheel called Chakraratna (“Chakra” means wheel and “ratna” means precious jewel) that would never miss its target. After developing his army and weapons, he embarked upon his journey of conquest. There was hardly anyone at the time who could withstand his well-equipped army. He easily conquered all the regions around Vinitä. Then, he turned his attention towards the lands of his 98 brothers and asked them to acknowledge his superiority. They all turned to Bhagawän Rishabhadev to ask for advice. Bhagawän explained to them the importance of conquering their inner enemies (passions) and not external enemies. He also advised them on how to attain liberation, a “true kingdom.” Having realized the futility of fighting with their elder brother, the sons surrendered their territories to him, renounced worldly life, and became disciples of Bhagawän Rishabhadev."

Moreover, he had the will and capacity to fight any invader. Therefore, when he received Bharat’s request to accept a subordinate status, he refused and began preparations to fight."

Therefore, counselors on both sides tried to dissuade their masters from resorting to war, but neither of them would give up their ground. War seemed inevitable as the brothers brought their armies face to face on the battlefield. Everyone shuddered at the prospect of the heavy casualties that would result from the imminent war."

Instead of assembling a large-scale war for that purpose, a fight between the two brothers would just as easily settle the issue and would avert unnecessary bloodshed. Both brothers thought this was an excellent idea and immediately agreed. The plan was to engage in a duel, and the victor would be acknowledged as the leader."

      "tagHTML": "On the day of the duel, Bharat tried to beat Bähubali by using his various permissible weapons, but all his attempts to defeat Bähubali failed. Bharat contemplated on how unbearable and shameful his defeat would be. His ambition to rule the entire world was also at stake if he did not defeat his brother. He grew desperate and ignored the rules of the duel by unleashing his miracle wheel, the Chakraratna, at Bähubali. However, he had forgotten one important characteristic of the miracle weapon: it would not harm any blood relatives of the bearer. Therefore, Bähubali remained unharmed."

      "tagType": "p",
      "tagHTML": "But just as he was about to unleash his wrath, a flash of insight came to him. “What am I doing?” thought Bähubali. “Have I gone mad? Am I going to kill my elder brother for the sake of some worldly possessions that my revered father willingly abandoned and which my other brothers have given up?” He shuddered at the prospect of the imminent death of Bharat, seeing the evil in killing a respected brother. At that very moment he changed his mind. Instead of lowering his hand to hit his brother, he used it to pull out his hair (as the monks do during Dikshä) as a symbol of giving up everything and renouncing the worldly life."

He realized that if he went to his father and stated his intention of renouncing the world, he would be required to bow down and be subservient to his 98 younger brothers who were senior to him in monkhood. This was unacceptable to him. Instead, Bähubali decided to seek enlightenment on his own and started meditating on the very same spot upon which he stood. He became so immersed in his meditation that he lost track of time and could not remember how long he had stood there. He was motionless for so long that plants and creepers began to grow around his feet."

      "tagHTML": "A year passed with Bähubali standing in that posture of meditation, yet he did not gain enlightenment. How could he gain it without shedding his ego? At last, Bhagawän Rishabhadev sent Brähmi and Sundari to bring him to the right path. They came to the place where Bähubali was meditating. Seeing their mighty brother standing like a rock, they calmly told him, “You cannot achieve enlightenment while sitting on an elephant. You need to get off the elephant.” As their familiar voices reached Bähubali’s ears, he opened his eyes in amazement and looked around but did not find himself on an elephant. He then realized that the elephant they were referring to, was his ego. He immediately dissolved his ego and decided to go to Bhagawän Rishabhadev and was ready to bow down to his 98 younger brothers."

Now his ego was dissolved, and humbleness prevailed in its place. Therefore, as he took the first step towards the Lord, he achieved full enlightenment and became omniscient. (By Digambar tradition, Bähubali later became the first person to attain liberation in this era. However, Shvetämbar tradition indicates that Rishabhadev’s mother, Marudevi, attained liberation first in this era.)"

He was the first Chakravarti of the current time cycle of Avasarpini Ärä. As a ruler, he ruled equitably and in the interest of all, and the people were happy under his administration. India was recognized as Bharatvarsha. He himself was happy in every respect and ruled for a very long time."

His curiosity overtook him, and he removed all his rings. Seeing that his fingers were no longer beautiful, he took off his crown and other ornaments decorating his body and looked in the mirror. He realized that he did not look as handsome as he used to look."
    },
    {
      "tagType": "p",
      "tagHTML": "This set off a train of thoughts. “I consider myself handsome and strong, but this entire look is merely due to the ornaments which do not belong to the body. The body itself is made up of blood and bones. Then why am I so attached to my body?” He thought further. “My body will not last forever and will decompose sooner or later. At that stage, I will have to leave everything behind. The only everlasting entity is the soul.” He realized that nothing in the world, including his body, really belonged to him, and soon came to a major decision. “Why not detach from all of the temporary things in life and instead focus on something that lasts forever like my father did?” Thus, he developed an acute detachment for the worldly life. As per Shvetämbar tradition, this reflection led to the rise of true enlightenment from within. As a result, he attained omniscience, or Keval-jnän, in that very room as a lay person. According to Digambar tradition, after he attained an acute detachment of worldly life, he renounced that life and became a monk, immediately achieving Keval-jnän. At the end of his life, he attained liberation."
