Knowing the truth would lead to the deer's death, the king cleverly avoided a direct answer, speaking only of irrelevant things until the frustrated hunter left. Later, he overheard <span class=\"highlight\">robbers</span> planning to attack a group of monks. When police arrived looking for the robbers, the king was again in a dilemma. He told them, “Why not go and look after the monks and worry about the robbers if they confront the monks?” The police left to guard the monks, and the grateful robbers, having overheard, thanked the king and promised to give up their life of crime."
