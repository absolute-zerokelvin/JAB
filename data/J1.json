He decided to go on a pilgrimage to a beautiful temple of <span class=\"highlight\">Rishabhadev</span> on Mount Ratnasringa. Leaving his kingdom in the care of his ministers, he set off on his spiritual mission. Shortly after his departure, a rival, <span class=\"highlight\">King Arjun</span>, attacked and conquered his kingdom."

However, the king replied, “I have given up control of the kingdom and we are on a spiritual mission, so that is what we should be thinking about.” Unhappy with his decision, his courtiers abandoned him one by one, until only a single umbrella bearer remained."

Knowing the truth would lead to the deer's death, the king cleverly avoided a direct answer, speaking only of irrelevant things until the frustrated hunter left. Later, he overheard <span class=\"highlight\">robbers</span> planning to attack a group of monks. When police arrived looking for the robbers, the king was again in a dilemma. He told them, “Why not go and look after the monks and worry about the robbers if they confront the monks?” The police left to guard the monks, and the grateful robbers, having overheard, thanked the king and promised to give up their life of crime."
