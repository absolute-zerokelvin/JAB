I will not give you this pigeon, but I can give you other food.” He ordered his servants to bring a basket of fruits and vegetables. However, the hawk said, “I am not a human being, and I am not a vegetarian. I need meat for my food.”"

This pigeon has sought refuge, and it is my duty to protect it. At the same time, it is also my duty to see that no one else is harmed in the process. Therefore, I will give my own flesh to the hawk.”"
